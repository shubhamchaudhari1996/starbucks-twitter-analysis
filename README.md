## Introduction

Choosing a new location for a coffee shop or a food restaurant is a costly endeavor and can prove risky in business if factors like population, sales, nearby industries, and entire human flow are not considered or mis calculated. The main aim of this project is to study 4 different aspects related to Starbucks Store and those are Starbucks Store Locations, Twitter Sentiments regarding Starbucks stores, Climate, and the Stocks. The motivation behind choosing these factors is to study and analyze climatic factors and public sentiments that affect existing Starbucks store’s locations and their stock prices. In this study, significant factors are highlighted which could affect store’s locations and revenue. To handle computational constraints, a mix of locations were taken into consideration aiming to include regions from USA and European countries. The study enabled us to understand the extent to which weather influences store locations as well as impact of social media such as twitter on economic conditions of stores. Previous research into the economic state of coffee shop locations sparked people's interest in the relationship between sentiment analysis and climatic impacts. In this study we are using Python as a main programming language to parse JSON and CSV data containing Starbucks store’s locations along with twitter sentiments and weather description for respective store locations. Initially these data will be in semi structured format and Mongo DB will be used to store these data. Semi structured data will be converted into structured data using python and we will use SQL DB to store structured data. Structured data will get fetched using python to further visualize and analyze the data. From our analysis we aim to see majorly affected Starbucks store’s locations by twitter comments and need to observe weather conditions in that locations. Data analysis employed in this study is integral so that it can help customers to understand climate and reviews of Starbucks locations by looking at this data and employed strategies. We are hoping to see if data analysis will provide a better image of what we can see through our eyes.
